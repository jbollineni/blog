In this blog, let's look at using snapcast server software in a container. 

[Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) is a synchronous multiroom client-server audio player. While Snapcast server has multiple configurable options for stream sources, this setup will use a named `pipe` as a source, from which Snapcast reads PCM chunks of audio data. Using named `pipe` as a source extends the ability to configure multiple audio sources - like Librespot (see Librespot Docker container) to send audio output.

```
|Librespot|---write to---> /tmp/snapcast/fifo <---read from--- |snapcast server| ~~~ network ~~~ |[snapcast clients]|
```


## Setup

The snapcast-server docker image is available on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jbollineni/snapcast-server). The container requires two inputs - a `snapserver.conf` file and `fifo` pipe file. The files on the filesystem are passed to the containers via docker volumes.

- Assuming `smarthome` is a your home-automation directory, create a directory with the name `snapcast` and create a file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following contents.


```
---
services:
  snapcast-server:
    image: jbollineni/snapcast-server:latest
    network_mode: "host"        
    restart: on-failure
    volumes:
      - /opt/smarthome/snapcast/snapserver.conf:/etc/snapserver.conf:ro
      - /tmp/snapcast/fifo:/tmp/snapcast/fifo
```

- Add another file called `snapserver.conf` to snapcast directory with the following contents, which tells snapcast server the path to the named `fifo` pipe as well as the audio sample format. See [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) documentation for more options on setting up sources.


```
[stream]
stream = pipe:///tmp/snapcast/fifo?name=Librespot-docker&sampleformat=44100:16:2
```

*Note: The sample format is set to* `44100:16:2` *to match the* `Librespot` *source's sample format.* 

- Create a named pipe file


```
mkdir -p /tmp/snapcast
mkfifo /tmp/snapcast/fifo
```

## Run container

Navigate to the `snapcast` directory and run docker compose command

```
cd /opt/smarthome/snapcast
docker compose up -d
```

## Verify container

```
[violet@home snapcast]$ docker ps | grep snapcast
